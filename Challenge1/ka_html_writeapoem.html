        <h1><The Cat in the Hat </h1>
        <h2> by Dr. Seuss</h2>

        <p> The sun did not shine. <br>
It was too wet to play. <br>
So we sat in the house <br>
All that cold, cold, wet day. <br>
I sat there with Sally. <br>
We sat there, we two. <br>
And I said, “How I wish <br>
We had something to do!” <br>
Too wet to go out <br>
And too cold to play ball. <br>
So we sat in the house. <br>
We did nothing at all. <br>
So all we could do was to <br>
Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! <br>
And we did not like it. <br>
Not one little bit. <br>
And then <br>
Something went BUMP! <br>
How that bump made us jump! <br>
We looked! <br>
Then we saw him step in on the mat! <br>
We looked! <br>
And we saw him! <br>
The Cat in the Hat! <br>
And he said to us, <br>
“Why do you sit there like that?” <br>
“I know it is wet <br>
And the sun is not sunny. <br>
But we can have <br>
Lots of good fun that is funny!” <br>
“I know some good games we could play,” <br>
Said the cat. <br>
“I know some new tricks,” <br>
Said the Cat in the Hat. <br>
“A lot of good tricks. <br>
I will show them to you. <br>
Your mother <br>
Will not mind at all if I do.” <br>
Then Sally and I <br>
Did not know what to say. <br>
Our mother was out of the house <br>
For the day. <br>
But our fish said, “No! No! <br>
Make that cat go away! <br>
Tell that Cat in the Hat <br>
 You do NOT want to play. <br>
He should not be here. <br>
He should not be about. <br>
He should not be here <br>
When your mother is out!” <br>
“Now! Now! Have no fear. <br>
Have no fear!” said the cat. <br>
“My tricks are not bad,” <br>
Said the Cat in the Hat. <br>
“Why, we can have <br>
Lots of good fun, if you wish, <br>
With a game that I call <br>
 UP-UP-UP with a fish!” <br>
“Put me down!” said the fish. <br>
“This is no fun at all! <br>
Put me don!” said the fish. <br>
“I do NOT wish to fall!” <br>
“Have no fear!” said the cat. <br>
“I will not let you fall. <br>
I will hold you up high <br>
As I stand on a ball. <br>
With a book on one hand! <br>
And a cup on my hat! <br>
But that is not ALL I can do!’ <br>
Said the cat… </p>
